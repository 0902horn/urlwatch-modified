.TH URLWATCH "1" "February 2011" "urlwatch 1.12" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
urlwatch \- Watch web pages and arbitrary URLs for changes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B urlwatch
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
urlwatch watches a list of URLs for changes and prints out unified
diffs of the changes. You can filter always-changing parts of websites
by providing a "hooks.py" script.

.SH ADVANCED FEATURES
urlwatch includes some advanced features that you have to activate by creating
a hooks.py file that specifies for which URLs to use a specific feature. You
can also use the hooks.py file to filter trivially-varying elements of a web
page.
.SS ICALENDAR FILE PARSING
This module allows you to parse .ics files that are in iCalendar format and
provide a very simplified text-based format for the diffs. Use it like this
in your hooks.py file:

  from urlwatch import ical2txt

  def filter(url, data):
      if url.endswith('.ics'):
          return ical2txt.ical2text(data).encode('utf-8') + data
      # ...you can add more hooks here...
.SS HTML TO TEXT CONVERSION
There are three methods of converting HTML to text in the current version of
urlwatch: "lynx" (default), "html2text" and "re". The former two use
command-line utilities of the same name to convert HTML to text, and the last
one uses a simple regex-based tag stripping method (needs no extra tools).
Here is an example of using it in your hooks.py file:

  from urlwatch import html2txt

  def filter(url, data):
      if url.endswith('.html') or url.endswith('.htm'):
          return html2txt.html2text(data, method='lynx')
      # ...you can add more hooks here...
